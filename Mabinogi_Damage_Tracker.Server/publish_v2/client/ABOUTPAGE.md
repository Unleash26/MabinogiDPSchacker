# About
This app monitors damage, chat messages, and healing (due note healing is not fully accurate).\
The live page displays a log of scanned information, try typing in general chat or doing damage and you should see a log appear.

If you receive no logs try restarting the parser on the 'Settings' page while Mabinogi is open. Afterwards go back to the 'Settings' page and save the detected adapter to skip the auto scan next time you run the application.  
You need to have PCAP drivers and Dot Net installed. Go back to the Github repo for more information on setup and installation.  

Once you are ready press start recording and begin your run, after your run is complete click stop recording and your run will be saved.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**note:** If you are getting long numeric names (player ids) in the graphs it means that user has not typed in chat.\
To link player ids with player names they need to send a general chat message.  
After your recording is done head over to the 'Recordings' page, you can rename the recording or load it.

Thank you for your support and using the application. We are an open source passion project, check back to the [Github](https://github.com) page for updates!
